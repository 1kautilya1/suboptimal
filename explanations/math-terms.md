## Math Terms

Here you will find explanations of some math terms often used in Machine Learning. They may sound scary to beginners, but they are not that hard.

<td valign="top">Derivative of a function <tt>f(x)</tt></td>
<td>
    <p>Tells you how much the function <tt>f</tt> is changing - is it increasing or decreasing.</p>
    <p>The derivative is another function that tells you how much the original function is changing at this particular point.</p>
    <p>If the derivative is 0, then <tt>f</tt> is not changing. If it is positive, <tt>f</tt> is increasing and if it is negative, <tt>f</tt> is decreasing.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Partial derivative of a function <tt>f(x,y)</tt>td>
<td>
    <p>Tells you how much the function <tt>f</tt> is changing if you change only one of the argument.</p>
    <p>When using a partial derivative, you always need to specify with respect to which argument you compute it. Then it is the same as a regular derivative.</p>
