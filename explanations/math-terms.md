## Math Terms

Here you will find explanations of some math terms that are often used in Machine Learning and that may sound scary to beginners. They are not...

<td valign="top">Derivative of a function `f(x)`</td>
<td>
    <p>Tells you how much the function `f` is changing - is it increasing or decreasing.</p>
    <p>The derivative is another function that tells you how much the original function is changing at this particular point.</p>
    <p>If the derivative is 0, then `f` is not changing. If it is positive, `f` is increasing and if it is negative, `f` is decreasing.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Partial derivative of a function `f(x,y)`</td>
<td>
    <p>Tells you how much the function `f` is changing if you change only one of the argument.</p>
    <p>When using a partial derivative, you always need to specify with respect to which argument you compute it. Then it is the same as a regular derivative.</p>
