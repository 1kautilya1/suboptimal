    <p>Embeddings are commonly used to create representations of objects or features that are suitable for particular machine learning algorithms.</p>
    <p>One example is working with words in Natural Language Processing. Words are usually transformed to a list of numbers  (embedded) before given as input to a neural network. The exact mapping between word and the list of numbers will be automatically learned.</p>
