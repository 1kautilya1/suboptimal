# SUBOPTIMAL - Seriously Unnecessary Baffling Obscure Perplexing Terms In MAchine Learning

Starting with Machine Learning is difficult... Everybody is using complicated and confusing terms ðŸ¤”? There are complicated math formulas everywhere ðŸ˜³? You don't understand anything ðŸ˜¬?

Don't worry, you came to the right place! This page will explain those perplexing terms in human language. And let me tell you a secret... most things are actually not that hard! ðŸ˜‰

## Machine Learning Terms

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)</td>
<td>
    <p>A simple function of `x` returning 0 if `x < 0` or `x` otherwise</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Embedding</td>
<td>
    <p>A representation of an object as a list of numers.</p>
    <p>Embeddings are commonly used to create representations of objects or features that are suitable for particular machine learning algorithms.</p>
    <p>One example is working with words in Natural Language Processing. Words are usually transformed to a list of numbers  (embedded) before given as input to a neural network. The exact mapping between word and the list of numbers will be automatically learned.</p>

## Math Terms

<table>
<thead>

<th>Term</th>
<th>Human Language Translation</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Derivative of a function `f(x)`</td>
<td>
    <p>Tells you how much the function `f` is changing - is it increasing or decreasing.</p>
    <p>The derivative is another function that tells you how much the original function is changing at this particular point.</p>
    <p>If the derivative is 0, then `f` is not changing. If it is positive, `f` is increasing and if it is negative, `f` is decreasing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Partial derivative of a function `f(x,y)`</td>
<td>
    <p>Tells you how much the function `f` is changing if you change only one of the argument.</p>
    <p>When using a partial derivative, you always need to specify with respect to which argument you compute it. Then it is the same as a regular derivative.</p>

    <p>Mean Square Error (SME)</p>
    <p><img width="400px" src="images/mse_formula.png"></p>
</td>
<td>
    <p>A function that measures how good a predicted value `Å¶` mathes some ground truth value `Y`.</p>
    <p>It computes the error by taking the difference between the two values and computing the square. In this way the error is always positive.</p>
    <p>You then take the average of the error from all samples by summing the errors up `Î£` and dividing by the number of samples `n`.</p>
