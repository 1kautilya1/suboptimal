# Contributing to SUBOPTIMAL

Thank you for taking the tie to contribute and make machine learning more accessible to people that are starting out!

Feel free to contribute an explanation to any of the categories, by creating a pull request.

## Explaining Terms

When explaining machine learning or math terms try to give a very short explanation in the first paragraph - just one sentence!

After that you should describe the term in more details and possibly provide a link with more information.

## Explaining Math Formulas

Again, in the first sentance give a very brief explanation what is the formula used for.

Then, explain the different parts of the formula in more detail and why it is done in this way.

Include an image of the formula in the Term column and another image with annotations explaining different parts.
