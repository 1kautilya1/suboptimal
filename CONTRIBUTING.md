# Contributing to SUBOPTIMAL

Thank you for taking the tie to contribute and make machine learning more accessible to beginners!

Feel free to contribute an explanation to any of the categories by creating a pull request.

## Explaining Terms

When explaining machine learning or mathematical terms, try to give a short explanation in the first paragraph - just one sentence!

After that, you should describe the term in more detail and possibly provide a link with more information.

## Explaining Math Formulas

Again, in the first sentence, give a very brief explanation of the formula.

Then, explain the different parts of the formula in more detail. Explain how it works and why.

Include an image of the formula in the Term column and another one with annotations explaining different parts.
